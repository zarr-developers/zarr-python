Zarr is a powerful library for storage of n-dimensional arrays, supporting chunking,
compression, and various backends, making it a versatile choice for scientific and
large-scale data.

Zarr-Python is a Python library for reading and writing Zarr groups and arrays. Highlights include:

* Specification support for both Zarr format 2 and 3.
* Create and read from N-dimensional arrays using NumPy-like semantics.
* Flexible storage enables reading and writing from local, cloud and in-memory stores.
* High performance: Enables fast I/O with support for asynchronous I/O and multi-threading.
* Extensible: Customizable with user-defined codecs and stores.

## Installation

Zarr requires Python 3.11 or higher. You can install it via `pip`:

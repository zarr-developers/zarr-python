Installation
============

Zarr depends on NumPy. It is generally best to `install NumPy
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/install.html>`_ first using whatever method is most
appropriate for your operating system and Python distribution. Other dependencies should be
installed automatically if using one of the installation methods below.

Install Zarr from PyPI::

    $ pip install zarr

Alternatively, install Zarr via conda::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge zarr

To install the latest development version of Zarr, you can use pip with the
latest GitHub main::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python.git

To work with Zarr source code in development, see `Contributing <contributing.html>`_.

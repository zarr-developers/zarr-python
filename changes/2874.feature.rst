Adds zarr-specific data type classes. This replaces the internal use of numpy data types for zarr
v2 and a fixed set of string enums for zarr v3. This change is largely internal, but it does
change the type of the ``dtype`` and ``data_type`` fields on the ``ArrayV2Metadata`` and
``ArrayV3Metadata`` classes. It also changes the JSON metadata representation of the
variable-length string data type, but the old metadata representation can still be
used when reading arrays. The logic for automatically choosing the chunk encoding for a given data
type has also changed, and this necessitated changes to the ``config`` API.

0-dimensional arrays are now returning an instance of ``ScalarWrapper``, which behaves like a scalar
but follow the ``NDArrayLike`` interface. This change is to make the behavior of 0-dimensional arrays
consistent with ``numpy`` scalars while not breaking the output format of the ``NDArrayLike`` interface.

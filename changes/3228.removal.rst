Removes default chunk encoding settings (filters, serializer, compressors) from the global
configuration object.

This removal is justified on the basis that storing chunk encoding settings in the config required
a brittle, confusing, and inaccurate categorization of array data types, which was particularly
unsuitable after the recent addition of new data types that didn't fit naturally into the
pre-existing categories.

The default chunk encoding is the same (Zstandard compression, and the required object codecs for
variable length data types), but the chunk encoding is now generated by functions that cannot be
reconfigured at runtime. Users who relied on setting the default chunk encoding via the global configuration object should
instead specify the desired chunk encoding explicitly when creating an array.

This change also adds an extra validation step to the creation of Zarr V2 arrays, which ensures that
arrays with a ``VariableLengthUTF8`` or ``VariableLengthBytes`` data type cannot be created without the
correct "object codec".

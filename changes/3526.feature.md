Increased the default value of `async.concurrency` from 10 to 64 to improve parallelism and throughput for concurrent I/O operations. This change enables better performance out-of-the-box for most workloads. Users with specific resource constraints or when using many Dask threads may want to lower this value via the `ZARR_ASYNC_CONCURRENCY` environment variable or by setting `zarr.config.set({'async.concurrency': N})`.

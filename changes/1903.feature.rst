Added official support for the Pyodide/WebAssembly platform for using Zarr within browser-based environments.
The ``threading.max_workers`` parameter takes a default value of 1, and the ``zarr.sync`` interface is not
supported. At the moment, using Zarr requires the JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) WebAssembly feature
to be enabled with Pyodide and is hidden behind flags in web browsers to enable experimental support. See the
`JavaScript Promise Integration reference <https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration>`_ and
`WebAssembly feature status <https://webassembly.org/features/>`_ pages for more details.

- This pull request resolves the issue of deadlocks and indefinite hangs when
  opening Zarr v3 arrays on synchronous fsspec filesystems, by implementing a
  fallback to sequential reads for non-concurrency-safe filesystems, ensuring
  robust metadata retrieval without sacrificing performance for safe
  filesystems. Furthermore ``Store._get_many`` was modified to retrieve objects
  concurrently from storage. The previous implementation was sequential,
  awaiting each ``self.get(*req)`` before proceeding, contrary to the
  docstring.
- Introduced ``StorePath.get_many``, mimicing the behaviour of `StorePath.get`.
- Use ``Store._get_many`` and ``StorePath.get_many`` in ``get_array_metadata``.
- Implemented ``FsspecStore._get_many`` to conditionally use ``asyncio.gather``
  based on the concurrency safety of the underlying file system, enhancing
  compatibility with synchronous file systems by avoiding deadlocks when
  accessing metadata concurrently. Adding tests ``LockableFileSystem`` to test
  with async/sync behavior.

- Expand the range of types accepted by ``parse_data_type`` to include strings and Sequences.
- Move the functionality of ``parse_data_type`` to a new function called ``parse_dtype``. This change
  ensures that nomenclature is consistent across the codebase. ``parse_data_type`` remains, so this
  change is not breaking.

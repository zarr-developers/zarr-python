Added several performance optimizations to chunk encoding and decoding. Low-latency stores that do not benefit from
`async` operations can now implement synchronous IO methods which will be used when available during chunk processing.
Similarly, codecs can implement a synchronous API which will be used if available during chunk processing.
These changes remove unnecessary interactions with the event loop.

The synchronous chunk processing path optionally uses a thread pool to parallelize execution. The number of threads is chosen
based on the estimated compute load of each chunk, which takes into account known encoding and decoding profiles for
different codecs. This algorithm is aware of the latency required for setting up the thread pool, and for
single-chunk workloads we skip the thread pool entirely.

Use of the thread pool can be disabled in the global configuration. The minimum number of threads
and the maximum number of threads can be set via the configuration as well.

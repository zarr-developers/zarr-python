Implement open() for LoggingStore
LoggingStore is now a generic class.
Use stdout rather than stderr as the default stream for LoggingStore
Ensure that ZipStore is open before getting or setting any values
Update equality for LoggingStore and WrapperStore such that 'other' must also be a LoggingStore or WrapperStore respectively, rather than only checking the types of the stores they wrap.
Indicate StoreTest's `test_store_repr`, `test_store_supports_writes`, `test_store_supports_partial_writes`, and `test_store_supports_listing` need to be implemented using `@abstractmethod` rather than `NotImplementedError`.
Separate instantiating and opening a store in StoreTests
Test using Store as a context manager in StoreTests
Match the errors raised by read only stores in StoreTests
Test that a ValueError is raise for invalid byte range syntax in StoreTests
Test getsize() and getsize_prefix() in StoreTests
Test the error raised for invalid buffer arguments in StoreTests
Test that data can be written to a store that's not yet open using the store.set method in StoreTests

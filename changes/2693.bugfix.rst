Implement open() for LoggingStore
LoggingStore is now a generic class.
Use stdout rather than stderr as the default stream for LoggingStore
Ensure that ZipStore is open before getting or setting any values
Update equality for LoggingStore and WrapperStore such that the types must be equal.
Indicate StoreTest's `test_store_repr`, `test_store_supports_writes`, `test_store_supports_partial_writes`, and `test_store_supports_listing` need to be implemented using `@abstractmethod` rather than `NotImplementedError`.

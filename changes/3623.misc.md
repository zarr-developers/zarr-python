This PR contains minor, non-function-altering, changes to use `ZarrFormat` across the repo as opposed to duplicating is with `Literal[2,3]`.

Additionally, it fixes broken linting by using a `Literal[True, False]` type hint for Numpy hypothesis testing, as opposed to `bool`.

Basically improves the typehints and reduces fat-finger error surface area slightly.

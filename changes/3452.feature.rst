Add optional uvloop support for improved async performance.

When uvloop is available, Zarr will automatically use it as the event loop implementation
for better I/O performance. This can be controlled via the ``async.use_uvloop`` configuration
setting or the ``ZARR_ASYNC__USE_UVLOOP`` environment variable. uvloop can be installed
with ``pip install 'zarr[optional]'`` (Unix/Linux/macOS only).

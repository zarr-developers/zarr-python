    Runs of equal sizes collapse to `[size, count]` pairs, because that is

    equal chunks is two numbers, not a million. A run of one stays a bare
    size, and `[size, 1]` collapses to one, since a pair says nothing extra
    there. Adjacent spellings of the same size merge, which is what makes
    this idempotent: `[[32, 2], 32]` and `[32, [32, 2]]` both become
    `[[32, 3]]`.

    A dimension-level bare integer is left alone. It is a *step* that
    repeats until it covers the extent, so it is not equivalent to any
    fixed list: expanding it would pin a grid that currently adapts, and
    the two would diverge the moment the array were resized. For the same
    reason a one-element list is never collapsed to a bare integer:
    `[32]` declares exactly one chunk and `32` declares as many as it takes.

"""Tests for RegularChunkGrid implementation."""

# Currently RegularChunkGrid tests are covered by:
# - test_common.py (normalize_chunks, _guess_chunks)
# - test_resolve_chunk_spec.py (resolve_chunk_spec with RegularChunkGrid)
# - Property-based tests in test_properties.py

# Future RegularChunkGrid-specific tests can be added here
